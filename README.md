Clothing Dataset

Shopping by stepping out of the home has become less regular in recent years. Who prefers traveling around the city for hours to browsing for their favorite shirt within minutes?
As online shopping is getting more popular, there is a surge in numerous companies which provide clothing delivery services. To contain the competition, companies devise unique algorithms that make choices easier for customers. The more data we use to train the algorithm, the better the results of the search. Normal users too can play with the data and the algorithm to include missing clothes in their wardrobe effectively to their interest.

Disruptive Possibilities- How Big Data changes everything by Jeffrey Needham

I would like to read this book to explore more about the potential of data science. I have gone through some content in the book and it clearly explains the architecture of the storage of large data sets in renowned companies. It covers all the past and latest applications of data science that helped the businesses boom. This gave me the basic idea of the present data industry and yes, this helps me to research more in this field from the knowledge gained from the book.
