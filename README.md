Clothing Dataset

Shopping by stepping out of the home has become less regular in recent years. Who prefers traveling around the city for hours to browsing for their favorite shirt within minutes?
As online shopping is getting more popular, there is a surge in numerous companies which provide clothing delivery services. To contain the competition, companies devise unique algorithms that make choices easier for customers. The more data we use to train the algorithm, the better the results of the search. Normal users too can play with the data and the algorithm to include missing clothes in their wardrobe effectively to their interest.
